# Architecture Decisions

## ADR-001: Treat the LLM as an untrusted component
**Context:** LLM-generated SQL can be destructive, hallucinated, or expensive.
**Decision:** Safety never depends on the model behaving. Deterministic checks
(parser, allowlists, DB permissions) wrap every generated query.
**Consequences:** More engineering than a prompt-only approach, but guarantees
hold even when the model is wrong or manipulated.

## ADR-002: Database privileges are the final enforcement layer
**Context:** Application-level validation can have bugs.
**Decision:** The executor connects as a role with SELECT-only, column-level
grants. Session settings (timeouts, read-only flag) are defaults, not guarantees,
because a session can change them; privileges cannot be changed by the session.
**Consequences:** A validator bypass still cannot write data or read PII columns.

## ADR-003: uv for dependency management
**Context:** Reproducible installs matter for CI and deployment.
**Decision:** Use uv with a committed `uv.lock`; CI installs with `--locked`.
**Consequences:** Identical dependency versions locally and in CI, with fast installs.
